    "So far we have seen that the derivative of a function is the instantaneous rate of change of that function.  In other words, how does a function's output change as we change one of the variables.  In this lesson, we will learn about the chain rule, which allows us to see how a function's output change as we change a variable that function does not directly depend on.  The chain rule may seem complicated, but it is just a matter of following the prescribed procedure.  Learning about the chain rule, will allow us to take the derivative of more complicated functions that we will encounter in machine learning."

The chain rule allows us to solve the problem of seeing the change in output when our function does not **directly** depend on that changing variable, but depends on **a function ** that depends on a variable.  \n",
